# MOVIE CRITIC APP

![alt text](Movie_Critic_App.png)

**Version 1.0.0**

Movie Critic App is an application that allows people to become critics and leave reviews and ratings on their favorite movies or movies that weren't so great. Hopefully it'll be helpful, especially if you're as indecisive about what movies to watch as I am.

This project is for my Flatiron School ruby on rails project. I had decided to do this project because I knew it would test my abilities as developer. There are components of this project that stretched me and made me learn on the fly by implementing which as we all know is the best way for a developer to learn.
